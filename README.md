# High Level Description
This project is an interative GUI module using Processing https://processing.org/ and UnfoldingMap http://unfoldingmaps.org/.
The function is to display a world map with live Earthquake data feed from  http://earthquake.usgs.gov/.
Also it is required to show markers for earthquakes and major cities in the world. Sorting algorithms are applied to sort earthquake based on different level of magnitude.
